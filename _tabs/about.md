Hi—I'm **Putra Kaha**. This site is my hub for security **writeups**, CTF solutions, pentest notes, and quick cheat‑sheets. If you’re here to learn, verify a technique, or cross‑reference a finding, you’re in the right place.

## What you'll find here

* **CTF writeups** — step‑by‑step paths, payloads, and lessons learned.
* **Pentest notes** — reproducible PoCs with impact, mitigation, and mapping to OWASP/CIS/RMiT where relevant.
* **Cheat‑sheets** — short, copy‑pasteable commands for web, AD, cloud, and mobile testing.
* **Talks & slides** — decks, labs, and training materials I’ve released.

---

## Methodology & disclosure

* **Reproducibility first:** each writeup aims to provide exact steps and environment notes.

## Tools & lab

Burp Suite Pro, nmap, Nessus, sqlmap, dirsearch, BloodHound/Impacket, kerbrute, responder, Wireshark, Docker, k6, and a rotating cast of custom scripts.
